Graph traversal algorithm. 
A queue, an array for already-viewed vertices, 
and an array (index is the number of vertices) 
with distances from the current vertex (by index) 
to the initial vertex are used. It is immediately initialized 
with infinity (999). The desired vertex is also optional.
1. Each vertex has a neighbor. Insert the starting vertex in the queue.
2. Explore the new vertex and remove it from the queue. 
Check whether we have already considered this vertex 
(i.e., whether it exists in the vector of the reviewed vertices). 
Yes -  repeat this paragraph, no:
3. If necessary, we check whether we need it. Yes - we finish the work, no:
4. Add all neighbors to the stack. Then for each of the neighbors 
(the corresponding index) check its value in the range array. 
If the infinity (999) - infinity is changed by the value 
*value of the parent + 1* for each of the parent’s neighbors.
5. Add the considered vertex to the array of visited vertices.
Move to paragraph 2.

If the queue is empty, then we’ve bypassed the graph.
